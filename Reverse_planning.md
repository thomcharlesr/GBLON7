**Reverse Planning: Python Programming**

***Goal:***
My learning goal is to be proficient in Python programming, specifically to be able to build, deploy, and manage Python applications on AWS. This could include creating automated scripts, working with data analysis libraries like Pandas and NumPy, and building REST APIs with Flask or Django.

**Working Backward: Milestones to Achieve the Goal**

***Final Goal:***

Proficiency in Python programming with the ability to build, deploy, and manage applications on AWS.
**- Milestone 5:** Deploy Python Application on AWS
Action: Learn how to package and deploy a Python application using AWS services such as Lambda, EC2, or Elastic Beanstalk.
Resources: Follow AWS documentation and take the "Deploying Applications with AWS" module.
**- Milestone 4:** Building a Python Web Application
Action: Build a simple web application using Python and Flask or Django. This project will help me understand backend development and creating REST APIs.
Resources: Complete a project tutorial on building web applications with Flask/Django. Practice by deploying the web app locally.
**- Milestone 3:** Mastering Python Libraries
Action: Gain proficiency in essential Python libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical computations, and Matplotlib for data visualization.
Resources: Enroll in a course or follow online tutorials on Python data analysis libraries. Work on data-related projects using these libraries.
**- Milestone 2:** Python Programming Foundations
Action: Strengthen knowledge of core Python concepts like loops, functions, OOP (object-oriented programming), error handling, and file I/O.
Resources: Complete intermediate-level Python exercises and challenges on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or Codecademy.
**- Milestone 1:** Basic Python Syntax and Tools
Action: Start with learning the basic syntax of Python, understanding variables, conditionals, loops, and functions. Additionally, set up a Python environment using IDEs like PyCharm or Visual Studio Code.
Resources: Follow introductory Python courses such as "Python for Beginners" or "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python." Practice basic programming problems daily.
