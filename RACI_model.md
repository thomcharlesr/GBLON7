**RACI Model Activity**

**1. Describe the difference between R and A:**

*R (Responsible):*
The person or group who is responsible for getting the work done. This is the individual or team who actively completes the task or project. For example, if the project is to launch a new software feature, the responsible person could be the developer or project manager directly involved in implementing the work.

*A (Accountable):*
The person who is ultimately accountable for the completion of the task. They oversee the project and are responsible for ensuring the work meets expectations and is completed on time. This person has the final authority and is answerable for the outcome, even though they might not be directly involved in performing the task. For example, the accountable person could be the team leader or department head overseeing the project.

**2. Describe the difference between C and I:**

*C (Consulted):*
This person or group is consulted for input and feedback on the task or project. They provide expert advice, insights, or feedback before a decision or task is completed. These individuals are actively engaged in the process, but they do not have decision-making authority. For example, a consultant could be a subject matter expert or a legal advisor who helps shape the final product.

*I (Informed):*
This person or group is kept informed of progress, decisions, and outcomes related to the task or project. They are not involved in the task itself but need to stay updated. For example, this could be senior management or other departments who need to know about the progress for awareness but do not need to contribute directly.

**3. Can one person’s name appear in more than one category? Why or why not?**

Yes, one person’s name can appear in more than one category in the RACI chart. For instance, someone could be Responsible (R) for completing a task while also being Accountable (A) for ensuring that the task meets certain standards. This might occur in smaller teams where roles overlap, or in cases where someone is both executing and managing a task. However, it’s generally ideal to separate the "Responsible" and "Accountable" roles to ensure clarity and reduce potential conflicts in decision-making.
